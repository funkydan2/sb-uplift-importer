# Sermon Browser to Uplift Importer
[Wordpress](//wordpress.org) plugin to import [Sermon Browser](https://www.sermonbrowser.com) sermons into the [Uplift Wordpress theme](http://www.mojo-themes.com/item/uplift-church-wordpress-theme-responsive/).

It worked for converting our churches' website from the now abandoned Sermon Browser plugin to the custom posts of the Uplift Theme. It worked for [our church](//kpc.org.au), and is offered here without any promises, warranty, or supportâ€”but you may find it helpful!
